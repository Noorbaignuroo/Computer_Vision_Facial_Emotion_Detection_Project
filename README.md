# Computer Vision Facial Emotion Detection Project 

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Computer Vision project focused on Facial Emotion Detection using the Fer2013 dataset. Emotion detection from facial expressions is a crucial task in computer vision with a wide range of applications, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and facial recognition systems.

In this project, we leverage the Fer2013 dataset, a well-known dataset containing grayscale images of faces categorized into seven different emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. We aim to build a robust emotion detection model using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The Fer2013 dataset is an essential component of this project. It comprises the following key features:

- **Emotion Labels**: Each image in the dataset is labeled with one of the seven emotion categories, allowing us to train and test our model for emotion classification.

- **Facial Images**: The dataset consists of grayscale facial images with pixel values representing the intensity of each pixel. These images serve as the input to our emotion detection model.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python**: You should have Python installed on your system.

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Install deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras to build and train your model.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and experimenting with code, Jupyter Notebook is recommended.

- **Fer2013 Dataset**: Download the Fer2013 dataset and ensure it's properly organized in a directory for training and testing.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for training. This includes resizing images, data augmentation, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**: Create and train a deep learning model for emotion detection. You can use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other architectures suitable for image classification.

3. **Training**: Train your model using the training dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters and architectures to optimize model performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in emotion detection.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's predictions and explore misclassified samples to gain insights into its performance.

6. **Fine-Tuning**: If necessary, fine-tune your model to improve its accuracy and robustness.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, deploy the model in a real-time or batch processing environment for emotion detection in real-world scenarios.
